                              Today, in order to prove the existence of a document at a specific point in time you would be required to go to a notary, who would sign and stamp your document, and then submit it to a public registry. To prove the submission of that document you would have to return to a notary and request a letter attesting to the documentâ€™s existence in a particular registry.

                              Proof of Existence solves the necessity for 3rd party notarization and attestation by providing a trustless, digital interface in order to prove that a document existed in a certain state at a specific time.
